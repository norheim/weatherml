## Feedback from proposal:

Nice project idea! 

**I would recommend focusing on a single outcome initially (ex. precipitation)**, in order to make sure you have time to fully explore that problem. 

Working out what to do about a potential change over time in the data due to climate change sounds like a smart idea. Identifying whether itâ€™s there or not would be a good first step. If it is, working out what to do about it should be a good part of the project. 

Some options might be to look into clustering the data or weighting points using something like the importance method in the prescription recitation, as that might help you find training data that is most useful for making predictions for current day stuff, but you should feel free to experiment. 

Overall, though, I will be excited to see how the project turns out!
